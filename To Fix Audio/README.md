To fix the audio dropouts, you have to uninstall the THX Spatial Audio.
This can be done by using DriverStoreExplorer. https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer/releases

Delete any of the ones that say THX and then restart the computer.

Next install EqualizerAPO. I made an EQ preset to get you started. Its in this folder.

Apply it by overwriting the existing config in the EqualizerAPO\config directory and restart EqualizerAPO or your computer.

Enjoy sound that does not have a dynamic range compressor applied to it.
