# Razer Blade 15 2022 Drivers
This is a repository for the extracted drivers from the Windows recovery image.

Right click on a device in device manager and click update driver to use these folders.

KEY:

DKM - Human Interface Devices -> USB Input Device

MOU - Mouse

KBD - Keyboard

The audio driver can be found here since github hates files larger than 25mb: https://mega.nz/folder/JKpg0CzR#Fpz_skNCHcIkMq6yx_AN-A

Use this to add the audio driver to the driverstore and delete the old one: https://github.com/lostindark/DriverStoreExplorer/releases

I was unable to find what the rest were for, but the three listed above were the ones I was successfully able to find and update.

I will add more if I find any hiccups, but for now the rest of the drivers could be found on Windows Update. These are only the Razer proprietary developed drivers for the various devices on the computer I could currently find.
