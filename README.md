# Razer Blade 15 2022 Drivers
This is a repository for the extracted drivers from the Windows recovery image.

Right click on a device in device manager and click update driver to use these folders.

KEY:

DKM - Human Interface Devices -> USB Input Device

MOU - Mouse

KBD - Keyboard


I will add more if I find any hiccups, but for now the rest of the drivers could be found on Windows Update. For now this is only the Razer proprietary developed drivers for the various devices on the computer (mouse, keyboard)
